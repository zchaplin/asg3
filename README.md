Process requirements:
Your GitHub repository must show a history of incremental commits with useful commit messages, tracing back to an empty repository at the start.
My repository was not letting me commit or pull anything after I had finished my code so I made a new repository that only has the final code in it.I promise I tried to commit like 20 times I just didint know it wasint working becasue you dont see errors unless you are commiting through the terminal.

Where to play your game (a link to your deployed game):

How your design satisfies the experience requirements below

How all of your data assets (if you have any) were created:
I created all the assets myself in a drawing app

Gameplay/Experience requirements:

The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player:
Holding the arrow keys for continuous and pressing enter or space bar for discrete

The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact):
the player set the start but the phisics engine decides boincing and gravity.

3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass):
techinically I have four with the intro scene

Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes:
scenes that show you how many attempts it took.
